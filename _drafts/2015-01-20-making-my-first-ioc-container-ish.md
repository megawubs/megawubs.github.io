For a project I did recently I was not allowed to use any kind of framework. This was a challenge, as I've been a 
Laravel user for about three years now. But, this did give me an amazing opportunity to flex my muscles a bit and 
not only implement a few concepts I had learned the past years, but also program the working of those concepts. One 
of the things I love the most about Laravel is it's IoC container.
