I've been programming for a while now. It's not that hard anymore for me to get my mind around some particular problem or pattern inside PHP. But still, learning something completely new is hard. The new stuff, diving in and that feeling of not knowing just bothers me. 

As I've written before, I've started to learn Java. To be more specific, I'm learning myself to write an Android app. It's something I want to have more challenge in my education. One of my teachers is helping me with the design aspect of it. I'm the one that's diving into Java. Or, I should say "should be diving into Java". Because, how much I try, I'm stuck at following the course google has made. I haven't written a single line of code myself, it's all  simple copy paste work and reading the docs. But, docs are boring! I want to get stuff done, make cool animations and play with Material Design. But all of that requires me to read, copy, paste and try. Try to understand the system. And all of that while my mind keeps on thinking: "Ah, screw this! Just work on your open source PHP library, way more fun and you know how it works!" 
 
Somehow I think that my knowledge is hurting me. It's driving me mad! I want to learn, but my mind just doesn't want to process the information the way it used to when I started with programming. Back 
then, I had no clue what I was doing. My horizon was as far as my next bug. I didn't know about design patterns, best practises and all that stuff. I just wanted to create and learn. That learning brought me a few things. Better understanding of PHP, understanding of design patterns and best practices, but also a growing fear of learning the new and unknown. With a horizon that now contains all the knowledge I've gained in the past years, I cannot start in a new language the way I did a few years ago. 

It's like I don't want t learn Java, because I've all this knowledge about programming and I should use it! But, it's all different and new. Why am I not giving myself the time to learn, adapt and change? I don't want to be like this. I want to be open-minded and be able to start fresh in a new field or language. The knowledge I have gained from my years with PHP are useful, but they shouldn't put a higher bar on my own learning process.
