title: Hello Blog

It's getting there! Today I created my first [Jekyll blog][1], and connected it through [Github Pages][2] to my personal website. Pretty awesome! I'll soon post a detailed guide of how I got this site set-up.

Setting this stuff up and creating this first post was more than enough for today :)
