During my first education after high school I got into software development through simple PHP courses. The education itself didn't provide the amount of depth I needed to understand programming as a whole. So, after my teachers told me they couldn't teach me anything new, I turned to the web to learn all about it. Days after days I watched tutorials, read blog posts and challenged myself to write better and cleaner code. This investment paid off.

As of now, I can say that I understand the Object Orient Programming principle, have a fair amount of Linux knowledge and lately I've invested time in learning programming patterns. But I've done all of this learning and self challenging next to my education, on small projects. It's time for me to change this.

I've always felt that my education is blocking my natural way of learning. I need to get my hands dirty, to say it like that. I need to actually DO it, to make it click. That's why I've decided to switch from a full-time education to a part-time education. This way, I'll have more time on my hands to get them dirty! As of now, I'm looking for a challenge that I can combine with my part-time "HBO-ICT" education at "Christelijke Hogeschool Windesheim Zwolle" in the Netherlands.

Do you know if there is a business looking for someone like me, or if you are one? Please let me know!
