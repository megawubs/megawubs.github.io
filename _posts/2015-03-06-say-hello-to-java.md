I've started learning Java! I'll post my findings and thoughts here.

The fist thing I did was installing IntelliJ IDEA from the awesome guys at Netbrains. I LOVE their product called
PHPStorm and didn't want to use Netbeans, the IDE my teacher recommends. After setting up IntelliJ IDEA and
importing some of my settings from PHPStorm I was off to learn some new stuff.

The exercises I got where quit easy. I had to get used to the whole strongly typed stuff, but after a few 
hours it starts to sink in. I should mention that I've worked with C# for like 5 months a few years ago, so 
the strongly typed system isn't completely new to me.
  
## Java is different

As I said, I'm no stranger to strongly typed programming languages. But, with a few years of PHP under my belt it 
does take a few extra thoughts to get something easy done in a language like Java. Like building my first array 
containing an array of int's. Or is it my first int array filled with arrays of ints? I really have no idea how it's 
named but the syntax was this: 
 
{% highlight java %} I
int[][] ints = new int[9][9];
{% endhighlight java %}

It took me a few tries to get it right, something so easy. Its still not completly clicking in my mind. But yea, new language and all... And after this 
"initialisation" part, how the heck do I add data to it? I was confused. I was used to do stuff like this in one 
line, and not to think about the type it should be and length it should have. Finally I figured it out and got the basic part of the 
program I wanted to make working.

## Java is not so different

After two challenging exercises I found out that Java isn't really that different from my understanding of Object 
Orient Programming. It just forces you where PHP lets you choose what you want to do. I think that's the bottom line.
Where I now have to search for "how to do x in Java", where the same thing in PHP would be plain obvious for me.
PHP gives you a choice, Java just enforces a bunch of OO laws onto you. I'm happy I've learned these "laws" within 
PHP. Otherwise I wouldn't know if  I could have understood them all. Nonetheless, I'm curious if there ever will be a
time that Java comes naturally to me.
