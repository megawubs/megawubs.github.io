Hey! I'll keep it short. I'm a tall guy from the Netherlands who likes to learn anything about code. My main 
languages at the moment are PHP, JavaScript (Node), HTML and CSS. Besides these two, I have experience with Python, 
Bash, C# and SQL. I have even toyed a bit with Ruby once. I'm not to shy to learn new languages. The next semester 
(I'm studying Computer Science) I'll start learning Java.

I intent to write about a variety of subjects. From PHP, to JavaScript and all the things I learn in between.
